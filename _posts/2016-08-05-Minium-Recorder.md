We are happy to announce the release of Minium Recorder. Minium Recorder has been developed to ease and accelerate the creation of Minium tests. You no longer need to write all the code for your step definitions by hand. Now, you can simply tell Minium Recorder to start recording your interactions with the browser, perform the actions that correspond to the step that you want to define and, once you're done, an automation script is immediately available in Minium Developer.

One of the things that makes Minium Recorder different in relation to other automation script recorders is that, for each element that you interact with, Minium Recorder does not generate just one CSS selector. Instead, you can choose among a list of alternative expressions for each element that take advantage of all the methods available in the Minium API (like `withLabel`, `below`, `rightOf`, etc.) to build more readable and resilient expressions.

Check out the videos below to see Minium Recorder in action:
